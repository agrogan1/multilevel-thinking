<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On ignoring the random effects assumption in multilevel models: Review, critique, and recommendations;,citation_abstract=Entities such as individuals, teams, or organizations can vary systematically from one another. Researchers typically model such data using multilevel models, assuming that the random effects are uncorrelated with the regressors. Violating this testable assumption, which is often ignored, creates an endogeneity problem thus preventing causal interpretations. Focusing on two-level models, we explain how researchers can avoid this problem by including cluster means of the Level 1 explanatory variables as controls; we explain this point conceptually and with a large-scale simulation. We further show why the common practice of centering the predictor variables is mostly unnecessary. Moreover, to examine the state of the science, we reviewed 204 randomly drawn articles from macro and micro organizational science and applied psychology journals, finding that only 106 articles?with a slightly higher proportion from macro-oriented fields?properly deal with the random effects assumption. Alarmingly, most models also failed on the usual exogeneity requirement of the regressors, leaving only 25 mostly macro-level articles that potentially reported trustworthy multilevel estimates. We offer a set of practical recommendations for researchers to model multilevel data appropriately.;,citation_author=John Antonakis;,citation_author=Nicolas Bastardoz;,citation_author=Mikko Ronko;,citation_publication_date=2021-10;,citation_cover_date=2021-10;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428119877457;,citation_doi=10.1177/1094428119877457;,citation_issn=1094-4281;,citation_volume=24;,citation_journal_title=Organizational Research Methods;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal;,citation_abstract=Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ’gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.  2012 Elsevier Inc.;,citation_author=Dale J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Are children oppressed? The timely importance of answering this question;,citation_abstract=Oppression is a politically-determined status with implications for policy, practice, and education. Oppressed groups are broadly considered to be vulnerable to exploitation and discrimination. As a result, additional legal, ethical, and service standards are established to ensure that this predictable mistreatment is avoided or addressed. Similar to populations that are currently recognized as oppressed, children do not fully experience the right to vote or access to resources. They have increased exposure to violence and are a minority group, which constrains equal opportunity. Recognition of children as an oppressed group could help expand their protections and opportunities. Actions that can begin to rectify the rights of children include: the addition of children in anti-oppression teaching and research, scholarship that focuses on children’s rights that may be infringed upon, guaranteeing funds specifically designed for children’s benefit, consideration of children’s capacity and opinions in decision-making, and the creation of government entities to regulate and promote mechanisms for prudently expanding the rights of children.;,citation_author=Richard P.

However, English differs from other languages in ways that have consequences for the whole of the cognitive sciences, reaching far beyond the study of language itself. Here, we review an emerging body of evidence that highlights how the particular characteristics of English and the linguistic habits of English speakers bias the field by both warping research programs (e.g., overemphasizing features and mechanisms present in English over others) and overgeneralizing observations from English speakers? behaviors, brains, and cognition to our entire species.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Liberation Social Psychology: Learning From Latin America Psychology of liberation: Learning from Latin America;,citation_abstract=Liberation Social Psychology (la psicologia social de la liberacion, LSP) has developed amongst a body of psychologists in Latin America over the last decade. There has been no survey of the field in English, although some of the ideas are of relevance for those working with oppressed groups elsewhere in the world. This article explores the context in which LSP grew from the work of Ignacio Martin-Baro and was developed by Maritza Montero, amongst others. Within LSP, key concepts emerge, including ’conscientization’, ’realismo-critico’, ’de-ideologization’, a social orientation, ’the preferential option for the oppressed majorities’ and methodological eclecticism. The application of LSP is explored with reference to three domains. First, it is suggested that community social psychology as practised in some parts of Latin America reflects LSP in its emphasis on social transformation and participatory methods. Second, psycho-social work with victims of state oppression, which adopts a highly social and societal orientation embodies LSP. Third, social analyses which explicitly adopt socio-psychological-political analyses of the social realities confronting countries in Latin America embrace, in different ways, principles and concepts of LSE Some of the challenges facing LSP are discussed and open dialogue is encouraged between LSP and critical, community and applied social psychologists.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neighborhood deprivation affects children’s mental health: Environmental risks identified in a genetic design;,citation_abstract=The possibility that neighborhood conditions affect children’s development has captured much attention because of its implications for prevention. But does growing up in deprived neighborhoods matter above and beyond a genetic liability to behavior problems, if genetically vulnerable families tend to concentrate in poor neighborhoods? A nationwide study of 2-year-old twins shows that children in deprived neighborhoods were at increased risk for emotional and behavioral problems over and above any genetic liability. Environmental factors shared by members of a family accounted for 20% of the population variation in children’s behavior problems, and neighborhood deprivation accounted for 5% of this family-wide environmental effect. The results suggest that the link between poor neighborhoods and children’s mental health may be a true environmental effect, and demonstrate that genetic designs are environmentally informative and can be used to identify modifiable risk factors for promoting child health.;,citation_author=Avshalom Caspi;,citation_author=Alan Taylor;,citation_author=Terrie E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=In defense of quantitative methods: Using the “master’s tools” to promote social justice;,citation_abstract=Empiricism in the form of quantitative methods has sometimes been used by researchers to thwart human welfare and social justice. Some of the ugliest moments in the history of psychology were a result of researchers using quantitative methods to legitimize and codify the prejudices of the day. This has resulted in the view that quantitative methods are antithetical to the pursuit of social justice for oppressed and marginalized groups. While the ambivalence toward quantitative methods by some is understandable given their misuse by some researchers, we argue that quantitative methods are not inherently oppressive. Quantitative methods can be liberating if used by multiculturally competent researchers and scholar-activists committed to social justice.

A sample of 466 European American and 100 African American children from a broad range of socioeconomic levels were followed from kindergarten through 3rd grade. Mothers reported their use of physical discipline in interviews and questionnaires, and mothers, teachers, and peers rated children’s externalizing problems annually. The interaction between ethnic status and discipline was significant for teacher- and peer-rated externalizing scores; physical discipline was associated with higher externalizing scores, but only among European American children. These findings provide evidence that the link between physical punishment and child aggression may be culturally specific.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond experiments;,citation_abstract=It is often claimed that only experiments can support strong causal inferences and therefore they should be privileged in the behavioral sciences. We disagree. Overvaluing experiments results in their overuse both by researchers and decision makers and in an underappreciation of their shortcomings. Neglect of other methods often follows. Experiments can suggest whether X causes Y in a specific experimental setting; however, they often fail to elucidate either the mechanisms responsible for an effect or the strength of an effect in everyday natural settings. In this article, we consider two overarching issues. First, experiments have important limitations. We highlight problems with external, construct, statistical-conclusion, and internal validity; replicability; and conceptual issues associated with simple X causes Y thinking. Second, quasi-experimental and nonexperimental methods are absolutely essential. As well as themselves estimating causal effects, these other methods can provide information and understanding that goes beyond that provided by experiments. A research program progresses best when experiments are not treated as privileged but instead are combined with these other methods.;,citation_author=Ed Diener;,citation_author=Robert Northcott;,citation_author=Michael J Zyphur;,citation_author=Stephen G West;,citation_publication_date=2022-02;,citation_cover_date=2022-02;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916211037670;,citation_doi=10.1177/17456916211037670;,citation_issn=1745-6916;,citation_volume=17;,citation_journal_title=Perspectives on Psychological Science;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Publishing child development research from around the world: An unfair playing field resulting in most of the world’s child population under-represented in research;,citation_abstract=Abstract It has become increasingly apparent that publishing research on child development from certain countries is especially challenging. These countries have been referred to collectively as the Majority World, the Global South, non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic), or low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this paper is to draw attention to these persistent challenges, and provide constructive recommendations to contribute to better representation of children from these countries in child development research. In this paper, we outline the history of publication bias in developmental science, and issues of generalization of research from these countries and hence where it ?fits? in terms of publishing. The importance of explaining context is highlighted, including for research on measurement child development outcomes, and attention is drawn to the vicious publication-funding cycle that further exacerbates the challenges of publishing this research.

Results indicate that deviant peer pressure and neighborhood problems partially mediate the relation between poverty and young adolescent antisocial behavior. The parenting practices and environmental influences that predict antisocial behavior do not vary by the child’s gender or race/ethnicity, and vary little by the child’s age.

Conventional statistical analysis cannot support them; Bayesian analysis can. The challenge in a Bayesian analysis is to formulate a suitably vague alternative, because the vaguer the alternative is (the more it spreads out the unit mass of prior probability), the more the null is favored. A general solution is a sensitivity analysis: Compute the odds for or against the null as a function of the limit(s) on the vagueness of the alternative. If the odds on the null approach 1 from above as the hypothesized maximum size of the possible effect approaches 0, then the data favor the null over any vaguer alternative to it.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Global perspectives on physical and nonphysical discipline: A Bayesian multilevel analysis;,citation_abstract=Background and Objective:Sixty countries worldwide have banned the use of physical punishment, yet little is known about the association of physical and nonphysical forms of child discipline with child development in a global context. The objective of this study is to examine whether physical punishment and nonphysical discipline are associated with child socioemotional functioning in a global sample of families from 62 countries and whether country-level normativeness of physical punishment and nonphysical discipline moderated those associations.Methods:Data for this study are from 215,885 families in the fourth and fifth rounds of the United Nations Children?s Fund Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Bayesian multilevel logistic models were used to analyze the associations of physical punishment and nonphysical discipline (i.e., taking away privileges and verbal reasoning) with three different outcomes representing children?s socioemotional functioning: getting along well with other children, aggression, and becoming distracted.Results:The use of physical punishment was not associated with getting along with other children, was associated with increased aggression, and was associated with increases in distraction. Taking away privileges was associated with lower levels of getting along with other children, higher levels of aggression, and higher levels of becoming distracted. Verbal reasoning (i.e., explaining why a behavior was wrong) was associated with higher levels of getting along with other children, higher levels of aggression, and higher levels of becoming distracted. Country-level normativeness moderated some of these associations but in general the direction of effects was consistent.Conclusions:Results suggest that eliminating physical punishment would benefit children across the globe and align with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which calls for all children to be free from physical violence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using Bayesian analysis to examine associations between spanking and child externalizing behavior across race and ethnic groups;,citation_abstract=While corporal punishment is widely understood to have undesirable associations with children’s behavior problems, there remains controversy as to whether such effects are consistent across different racial or ethnic groups. We employed a Bayesian regression analysis, which allows for the estimation of both similarities and differences across groups, to study whether there are differences in the relationship of corporal punishment and children’s behavior problems using a diverse, urban sample of U.S. families (n = 2653). There is some moderation of the relationship between corporal punishment and child behavior by race or ethnicity. However, corporal punishment is associated with increases in behavior problems for all children. Thus, our findings add evidence from a new analytical lens that corporal punishment is consistently linked to increased externalizing behavior across African American, White, or Hispanic children, even after earlier externalizing behavior is controlled for. Our findings suggest that corporal punishment has detrimental consequences for all children and that all parents, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, should be advised to use alternatives to corporal punishment.;,citation_author=Andrew Grogan-Kaylor;,citation_author=Julie Ma;,citation_author=Shawna J.

This narrative review summarises the findings of 69 prospective longitudinal studies to inform practitioners and policy makers about physical punishment’s outcomes. Our review identified seven key themes. First, physical punishment consistently predicts increases in child behaviour problems over time. Second, physical punishment is not associated with positive outcomes over time. Third, physical punishment increases the risk of involvement with child protective services. Fourth, the only evidence of children eliciting physical punishment is for externalising behaviour. Fifth, physical punishment predicts worsening behaviour over time in quasi-experimental studies. Sixth, associations between physical punishment and detrimental child outcomes are robust across child and parent characteristics. Finally, there is some evidence of a dose–response relationship. The consistency of these findings indicates that physical punishment is harmful to children and that policy remedies are warranted.;,citation_author=Anja Heilmann;,citation_author=Anita Mehay;,citation_author=Richard G Watt;,citation_author=Yvonne Kelly;,citation_author=Joan E Durrant;,citation_author=Jillian Turnhout;,citation_author=Elizabeth T Gershoff;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673621005821;,citation_doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00582-1;,citation_issn=0140-6736;,citation_journal_title=The Lancet;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The weirdest people in the world?;,citation_abstract=Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world’s top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers - often implicitly - assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species - frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior - hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity.

We draw data from the General Social Surveys (GSS) from 1986 through 2016, which asked respondents how much they agree children sometimes need “a good, hard spanking.” We compare responses among parents at the 80th (high-SES) and 20th (low-SES) percentiles of the income and education distributions, and between parents in southern versus non-southern states, controlling for child and parent age and parent gender. In non-southern regions, parents’ support for corporal punishment declined over time, especially among high-SES parents, whereas in the South parents’ support for corporal punishment remained stably high over time across the socioeconomic distribution. These findings imply a distinct cultural perspective on corporal punishment in the South, one that may help explain the disproportionate maintenance of the practice in schools and provide a potent target for policy and program interventions to reduce its use.;,citation_author=Caitlin T Hines;,citation_author=Ariel Kalil;,citation_author=Rebecca M Ryan;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02803-7;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11205-021-02803-7;,citation_issn=1573-0921;,citation_volume=160;,citation_journal_title=Social Indicators Research;">

The main result of our simulations is that a sample of about 20 countries is sufficient for accurate Bayesian estimation, which makes multilevel SEM practicable for the number of countries commonly available in large scale comparative surveys.;,citation_author=Joop Hox;,citation_author=Joop J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What are the odds? A practical guide to computing and reporting Bayes factors;,citation_abstract=The purpose of this paper is to provide an easy template for the inclusion of the Bayes factor in reporting experimental results, particularly as a recommendation for articles in the Journal of Problem Solving. The Bayes factor provides information with a similar purpose to the p-value—to allow the researcher to make statistical inferences from data provided by experiments. While the p-value is widely used, the Bayes factor provides several advantages, particularly in that it allows the researcher to make a statement about the alternative hypothesis, rather than just the null hypothesis. In addition, it provides a clearer estimate of the amount of evidence present in the data. Building on previous work by authors such as Wagenmakers (2007), Rouder et al. (2009), and Masson (2011), this article provides a short introduction to Bayes factors, before providing a practical guide to their computation using examples from published work on problem solving.;,citation_author=Andrew F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceived parental acceptance-rejection and psychological adjustment: A meta-analysis of cross-cultural and intracultural studies;,citation_abstract=Meta-analytic procedures were used to pool information from 43 studies worldwide to test one of the major postulates of parental acceptance-rejection theory (PARTheory). Specifically, using child and adult versions of the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire (PARQ) and the Personality Assessment Questionnaire (PAQ), these studies allowed us to assess the claim within PARTheory’s personality subtheory that perceived parental acceptance-rejection is associated universally with a specific form of psychological (mal)adjustment among children and adults, regardless of differences in gender, race, geography, language, or culture. Results of the analysis showed that the predicted relation emerged without exception in all studies. The mean weighted effect sizes across the full range of sociocultural and ethnic groups studied were r= .51 for children and r= .46 for adults. Analysis of fail safe N showed that 3,433 additional studies, all with nonsignificant results, would be required to disconfirm the pancultural association between the PARQ and PAQ among children; 941 such studies would be required to disconfirm this relation among adults.;,citation_author=Abdul Khaleque;,citation_author=Ronald P Rohner;,citation_publication_date=2002-02;,citation_cover_date=2002-02;,citation_year=2002;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00054.x;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00054.x;,citation_issn=0022-2445;,citation_volume=64;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Marriage and Family;,citation_publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons, Ltd;">

Although LMMs have many advantages over ANOVA, like ANOVAs, setting them up for data analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy, Scheepers &amp;amp;amp; Tily, 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal \alpha in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, higher power is achieved without inflating Type I error rate if a model selection criterion is used to select a random effect structure that is supported by the data.;,citation_author=Hannes Matuschek;,citation_author=Reinhold Kliegl;,citation_author=Shravan Vasishth;,citation_author=Harald Baayen;,citation_author=Douglas Bates;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01864;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jml.2017.01.001;,citation_issn=0749596X;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Memory and Language;">

The purpose of an ecologic analysis may be to make biologic inferences about effects on individual risks or to make ecologic inferences about effects on group rates. Ecologic study designs may be classified on two dimensions: (a) whether the primary group is measured (exploratory vs analytic study); and (b) whether subjects grouped by place (multiple-group study), by time (time-trend study), or place and time (mixed study).

In such an analysis an explicit account should be taken of the statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative variables and the effects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Bayesian structural equation modeling: A more flexible representation of substantive theory.;,citation_abstract=This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters are added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximum-likelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus.

For frequentist mixed models, previous research showed that excluding random slopes—differences between individuals in the direction and size of an effect—from a model when they are in the data can lead to a substantial increase in false-positive conclusions in null-hypothesis tests. Here, I demonstrated through five simulations that the same is true for Bayesian hypothesis testing with mixed models, which often yield Bayes factors reflecting very strong evidence for a mean effect on the population level even if there was no such effect. Including random slopes in the model largely eliminates the risk of strong false positives but reduces the chance of obtaining strong evidence for true effects. I recommend starting analysis by testing the support for random slopes in the data and removing them from the models only if there is clear evidence against them.;,citation_author=Klaus Oberauer;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976211046884;,citation_doi=doi:10.1177/09567976211046884;,citation_journal_title=Psychological Science;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Diversity science: Why and how difference makes a difference;,citation_abstract=This article proposes that addressing the complex ethnic and racial issues of the 21st century will require a diversity science. A diversity science will consider how people create, interpret, and maintain group differences among individuals, as well as the psychological and societal consequences of these distinctions. A diversity science will recognize that these significant social distinctions (in the case of this article, race and ethnicity) are not simply natural, neutral, or abstract. Instead they are created and recreated in the process of everyday social interactions that are grounded in historically derived ideas and beliefs about difference and in a set of practices and institutions that reflect these ideas and beliefs and that therefore shape psychological experience and behavior. According to this “sociocultural” framework, psychological experience and behavior, in turn, reinforce particular cultural and structural realities. As an initial step toward a diversity science, this article reviews the roots and consequences of two examples of how to think about difference, color blindness and multiculturalism. Through this sociocultural lens, intergroup behaviors can be understood as more than just products of individual prejudice. This article also proposes that a comprehensive diversity science requires a critical examination of majority group perspectives, minority group perspectives, and their dynamic interaction beyond the typical Black– White binary. Such a diversity science has the potential to help meaningfully inform race-related policy.;,citation_author=Victoria C.

To understand the importance of the perspective in the research reviewed by Wigglesworth et al., the authors discuss risk and protection in Indigenous suicide from systemic perspectives, concluding that it may now be time to move beyond protective factors and expand the complexity in American Indian and Alaska Native suicide research in ways that are guided by ecological models and systems theory. They offer examples taken from the studies reviewed by Wiglesworth et al. and discuss the implications of such transition for clinical practice, for multilevel theorizing that includes community and societal levels, and for advancing methods and models in suicide prevention research.

Parenting behaviors were measured using children’s reports on the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire. Child externalizing and internalizing behaviors were measured using mother, father, and child reports on the Achenbach System of Empirically-Based Assessment. Using a multilevel modeling framework, we found that in cultures where both maternal and paternal indifference/neglect scores were higher than average–compared to other cultures–children’s internalizing problems were more persistent. At the within-culture level, all four forms of maternal and paternal rejection (i.e., coldness/lack of affection, hostility/aggression, indifference/neglect, and undifferentiated rejection) were independently associated with either externalizing and internalizing problems across ages 7–14 even after controlling for child gender, parent education, and each of the four forms of parental rejection.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Conclusions beyond support: Overconfident estimates in mixed models;,citation_abstract=Mixed-effect models are frequently used to control for the nonindependence of data points, for example, when repeated measures from the same individuals are available. The aim of these models is often to estimate fixed effects and to test their significance. This is usually done by including random intercepts, that is, intercepts that are allowed to vary between individuals. The widespread belief is that this controls for all types of pseudoreplication within individuals. Here we show that this is not the case, if the aim is to estimate effects that vary within individuals and individuals differ in their response to these effects. In these cases, random intercept models give overconfident estimates leading to conclusions that are not supported by the data. By allowing individuals to differ in the slopes of their responses, it is possible to account for the nonindependence of data points that pseudoreplicate slope information. Such random slope models give appropriate standard errors and are easily implemented in standard statistical software. Because random slope models are not always used where they are essential, we suspect that many published findings have too narrow confidence intervals and a substantially inflated type I error rate. Besides reducing type I errors, random slope models have the potential to reduce residual variance by accounting for between-individual variation in slopes, which makes it easier to detect treatment effects that are applied between individuals, hence reducing type II errors as well.;,citation_author=Holger Schielzeth;,citation_author=Wolfgang Forstmeier;,citation_publication_date=2009-03;,citation_cover_date=2009-03;,citation_year=2009;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arn145;,citation_doi=10.1093/beheco/arn145;,citation_issn=1045-2249;,citation_volume=20;,citation_journal_title=Behavioral Ecology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tainted : How philosophy of science can expose bad science;,citation_abstract=Three-fourths of scientific research in the United States is funded by special interests. Many of these groups have specific practical goals, such as developing pharmaceuticals or establishing that a pollutant causes only minimal harm. For groups with financial conflicts of interest, their scientific findings often can be deeply flawed. To uncover and assess these scientific flaws, award-winning biologist and philosopher of science Kristin Shrader-Frechette uses the analytical tools of classic philosophy of science. She identifies and evaluates the concepts, data, inferences, methods, models, and conclusions of science tainted by the influence of special interests. As a result, she challenges accepted scientific findings regarding risks such as chemical toxins and carcinogens, ionizing radiation, pesticides, hazardous-waste disposal, development of environmentally sensitive lands, threats to endangered species, and less-protective standards for workplace-pollution exposure. In so doing, she dissects the science on which many contemporary scientific controversies turn. Demonstrating and advocating’liberation science,’she shows how practical, logical, methodological, and ethical evaluations of science can both improve its quality and credibility – and protect people from harm caused by flawed science, such as underestimates of cancers caused by bovine growth hormones, cell phones, fracking, or high-voltage wires. This book is both an in-depth look at the unreliable scientific findings at the root of contemporary debates in biochemistry, ecology, economics, hydrogeology, physics, and zoology – and a call to action for scientists, philosophers of science, and all citizens.;,citation_author=Kristin Shrader-Frechette;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_isbn=9780199396412;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of mexiletine on muscle stiffness in patients with nondystrophic myotonia evaluated using aggregated n-of-1 trials;,citation_abstract=Importance: In rare diseases it is difficult to achieve high-quality evidence of treatment efficacy because of small cohorts and clinical heterogeneity. With emerging treatments for rare diseases, innovative trial designs are needed. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of mexiletine in nondystrophic myotonia using an aggregated N-of-1 trials design and compare results between this innovative design and a previously conducted RCT. Design, Setting, and Participants: A series of aggregated, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled N-of-1-trials, performed in a single academic referral center. Thirty Dutch adult patients with genetically confirmed nondystrophic myotonia (38 patients screened) were enrolled between February 2014 and June 2015. Follow-up was completed in September 2016. Interventions: Mexiletine (600 mg daily) vs placebo during multiple treatment periods of 4 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Reduction in daily-reported muscle stiffness on a scale of 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating more impairment. A Bayesian hierarchical model aggregated individual N-of-1 trial data to determine the posterior probability of reaching a clinically meaningful effect of a greater than 0.75-point difference. Results: Among 30 enrolled patients (mean age, 43.4 [SD, 15.24] years; 22% men; 19 CLCN1 and 11 SCN4A genotype), 27 completed the study and 3 dropped out (1 because of a serious adverse event). In 24 of the 27 completers, a clinically meaningful treatment effect was found. In the Bayesian hierarchical model, mexiletine resulted in a 100% posterior probability of reaching a clinically meaningful reduction in self-reported muscle stiffness for the nondystrophic myotonia group overall and the CLCN1 genotype subgroup and 93% posterior probability for the SCN4A genotype subgroup. In the total nondystrophic myotonia group, the median muscle stiffness score was 6.08 (interquartile range, 4.71-6.80) at baseline and was 2.50 (95% credible interval [CrI], 1.77-3.24) during the mexiletine period and 5.56 (95% CrI, 4.73-6.39) during the placebo period; difference in symptom score reduction, 3.06 (95% CrI, 1.96-4.15; n = 27) favoring mexiletine. The most common adverse event was gastrointestinal discomfort (21 mexiletine [70%], 1 placebo [3%]). One serious adverse event occurred (1 mexiletine [3%]; allergic skin reaction). Using frequentist reanalysis, mexiletine compared with placebo resulted in a mean reduction in daily-reported muscle stiffness of 3.12 (95% CI, 2.46-3.78), consistent with the previous RCT treatment effect of 2.69 (95% CI, 2.12-3.26). Conclusions and Relevance: In a series of N-of-1 trials of mexiletine vs placebo in patients with nondystrophic myotonia, there was a reduction in mean daily-reported muscle stiffness that was consistent with the treatment effect in a previous randomized clinical trial. These findings support the efficacy of mexiletine for treatment of nondystrophic myotonia as well as the feasibility of N-of-1 trials for assessing interventions in some chronic rare diseases.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Analyzing small data sets using Bayesian estimation: the case of posttraumatic stress symptoms following mechanical ventilation in burn survivors;,citation_abstract=BackgroundThe analysis of small data sets in longitudinal studies can lead to power issues and often suffers from biased parameter values. These issues can be solved by using Bayesian estimation in conjunction with informative prior distributions. By means of a simulation study and an empirical example concerning posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following mechanical ventilation in burn survivors, we demonstrate the advantages and potential pitfalls of using Bayesian estimation.MethodsFirst, we show how to specify prior distributions and by means of a sensitivity analysis we demonstrate how to check the exact influence of the prior (mis-) specification. Thereafter, we show by means of a simulation the situations in which the Bayesian approach outperforms the default, maximum likelihood and approach. Finally, we re-analyze empirical data on burn survivors which provided preliminary evidence of an aversive influence of a period of mechanical ventilation on the course of PTSS following burns.ResultsNot suprisingly, maximum likelihood estimation showed insufficient coverage as well as power with very small samples. Only when Bayesian analysis, in conjunction with informative priors, was used power increased to acceptable levels. As expected, we showed that the smaller the sample size the more the results rely on the prior specification.ConclusionWe show that two issues often encountered during analysis of small samples, power and biased parameters, can be solved by including prior information into Bayesian analysis. We argue that the use of informative priors should always be reported together with a sensitivity analysis.;,citation_author=Rens Schoot;,citation_author=Joris J Broere;,citation_author=Koen H Perryck;,citation_author=Mariëlle Zondervan-Zwijnenburg;,citation_author=Nancy E Loey;,citation_publication_date=2015-12;,citation_cover_date=2015-12;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.3402/ejpt.v6.25216;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.3402/ejpt.v6.25216;,citation_issn=2000-8198;,citation_volume=6;,citation_journal_title=European Journal of Psychotraumatology;,citation_publisher=Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A gentle introduction to bayesian analysis: Applications to developmental research;,citation_abstract=Bayesian statistical methods are becoming ever more popular in applied and fundamental research. In this study a gentle introduction to Bayesian analysis is provided. It is shown under what circumstances it is attractive to use Bayesian estimation, and how to interpret properly the results. First, the ingredients underlying Bayesian methods are introduced using a simplified example. Thereafter, the advantages and pitfalls of the specification of prior knowledge are discussed. To illustrate Bayesian methods explained in this study, in a second example a series of studies that examine the theoretical framework of dynamic interactionism are considered. In the Discussion the advantages and disadvantages of using Bayesian statistics are reviewed, and guidelines on how to report on Bayesian statistics are provided.;,citation_author=Rens Schoot;,citation_author=David Kaplan;,citation_author=Jaap Denissen;,citation_author=Jens B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Can non-randomised studies of interventions provide unbiased effect estimates? A systematic review of internal replication studies;,citation_abstract=Background: Non-randomized studies of intervention effects (NRS), also called quasi-experiments, provide useful decision support about development impacts. However, the assumptions underpinning them are usually untestable, their verification resting on empirical replication. The internal replication study aims to do this by comparing results from a causal benchmark study, usually a randomized controlled trial (RCT), with those from an NRS conducted at the same time in the sampled population. Objectives: We aimed to determine the credibility and generalizability of findings in internal replication studies in development economics, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Research Design: We systematically searched for internal replication studies of RCTs conducted on socioeconomic interventions in low- and middle-income countries. We critically appraised the benchmark randomized studies, using an adapted tool. We extracted and statistically synthesized empirical measures of bias. Results: We included 600 estimates of correspondence between NRS and benchmark RCTs. All internal replication studies were found to have at least ?some concerns? about bias and some had high risk of bias. We found that study designs with selection on unobservables, in particular regression discontinuity, on average produced absolute standardized bias estimates that were approximately zero, that is, equivalent to the estimates produced by RCTs. But study conduct also mattered. For example, matching using pre-tests and nearest neighbor algorithms corresponded more closely to the benchmarks. Conclusions: The findings from this systematic review confirm that NRS can produce unbiased estimates. Authors of internal replication studies should publish pre-analysis protocols to enhance their credibility.;,citation_author=Hugh Sharma Waddington;,citation_author=Paul Fenton Villar;,citation_author=Jeffrey C Valentine;,citation_publication_date=2022-09;,citation_cover_date=2022-09;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0193841X221116721;,citation_doi=10.1177/0193841X221116721;,citation_issn=0193-841X;,citation_journal_title=Evaluation Review;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Econometric analysis of cross section and panel data;,citation_abstract=The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis.Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of &amp;amp;amp;quot;generalized instrumental variables&amp;quot; (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author’s own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the &quot;generalized estimating equation&quot; literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain &quot;obvious&quot; procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.;,citation_author=Jefrey M Wooldridge;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcfr;,citation_isbn=9780262232586;">

<p>For decades now, multilevel models have been an important quantitative tool for social research. While multilevel models have become very common in social research, there are aspects of these models that are explored less frequently in published articles that appear in academic journals. This book arises from my experiences of teaching a course entitled <em>Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling</em> that I have taught for over a decade in the <em>Joint Doctoral Program in Social Work and Social Science</em> at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>The book started out as a set of notes on <em>things I only get to discuss during breaks, or after class, or during office hours</em> in my class on <em>Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling</em>, and has grown from that set of notes into an introduction to multilevel modeling.</p>
<p>My contention is that <em>multilevel modeling</em> offers powerful tools for understanding the <em>multilevel data</em> that social researchers often confront. For example, researchers are often interested in studying outcomes for diverse groups of children in different schools, residents of diverse and different neighborhoods, or individuals or families living in diverse and different countries. Such inherently multilevel data lead to analytic complexities, some of which appear to me to be well understood, while others seem to be much less often appreciated.</p>
<p>The point that I wish to make about multilevel data is that when presented with complex multilevel data, failure to use the appropriate multilevel model may lead to conclusions that are demonstrably incorrect. Fortunately, many of these difficulties can be avoided with applications of simple and straightforward multilevel models. </p>
<p>I start by presenting some initial ideas about multilevel modeling. First, as is relatively commonly understood, <em>multilevel models allow for the correct estimation of p values in the presence of data clustering</em>. Second, as is less commonly appreciated, when data are clustered, <em>multilevel models correctly estimate <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> regression coefficients and may avoid estimating a regression coefficient that is too large, too small, or even has the wrong sign</em>. </p>
<p>I go on to explore some more complex ideas about multilevel models that I see less often in the published empirical literature. I focus especially on two ideas: <em>multilevel models as the exploration of diversity and variation across countries and cultures</em>; and <em>multilevel models as a foundation for models that let us think more rigorously about causality</em>. I argue that multilevel models provide a foundation for engaging with cross-cultural diversity in a quantitatively rigorous fashion.</p>
<p>Certainly, none of the statistical ideas contained in this book are unique to me. There are thorough–and often much more mathematically rigorous–presentations of many of the ideas contained in this book in some of the excellent foundational texts on multilevel modeling such as the early book by <span class="citation" data-cites="Raudenbush2002">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk (<a href="references.html#ref-Raudenbush2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>, the excellent book on longitudinal models by <span class="citation" data-cites="Singer2003">Singer &amp; Willett (<a href="references.html#ref-Singer2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="RabeHesketh2022">Rabe-Hesketh &amp; Skrondal (<a href="references.html#ref-RabeHesketh2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>’s more recent and extremely comprehensive two volume text. <span class="citation" data-cites="Luke2004">Luke (<a href="references.html#ref-Luke2004" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation" data-cites="Kreft1998">Kreft &amp; de Leeuw (<a href="references.html#ref-Kreft1998" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>, offer shorter, less mathematically rigorous, but still excellent introductions to the topic of multilevel modeling. <span class="citation" data-cites="Gelman2007">Gelman et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Gelman2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> introduced me to the ideas that in this book I describe as “multilevel structure” using an example with voting patterns.</p>
<p>My intent in this book is to offer a kind of accessible tutorial for applied researchers, including especially those who see their research having some advocacy based component. My approach, while offering up some equations, is less mathematically rigorous than some of the above mentioned texts, and written with the intent of providing a clear and practically focused guide for the applied researcher who is attempting to carry out better research with diverse populations.</p>
