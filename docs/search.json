    "text": "The Usefulness of Multilevel Modeling and Multilevel Thinking\n\n\n\nFor decades now, multilevel models have been an important quantitative tool for social research. While multilevel models have become ubiquitous in social research, there are dimensions of these models that are explored less frequently in published articles. This document arises from my experiences of teaching a course entitled Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling that I have taught for over a decade in the Joint Doctoral Program in Social Work and Social Science at the University of Michigan.\nMy contention is that multilevel modeling offers powerful tools for understanding the multilevel data that social researchers often confront. For example, researchers are often interested in studying outcomes for diverse groups of children in different schools, residents of diverse and different neighborhoods, or individuals or families living in diverse and different countries. Such inherently multilevel data lead to analytic complexities, some of which appear to me to be well understood, while others seem to be much less often appreciated.\nThe point that I wish to make about multilevel data is that when presented with complex multilevel data, failure to use the appropriate multilevel model may lead to conclusions that are demonstrably incorrect. Fortunately, many of these difficulties can be avoided with applications of simple and straightforward multilevel models.\nAfter presenting some initial ideas about multilevel modeling, I go on to explore some more complex ideas about multilevel models that I see less often in the published empirical literature. I focus especially on the idea of multilevel models as the exploration of variation across countries and cultures.\nCertainly, none of the statistical ideas contained in this document are unique to me. There are thorough–and often much more mathematically rigorous–presentations of many of the idea contained in this document in some of the excellent foundational texts on multilevel modeling such as the early book by Raudenbush and Bryk (2002), the excellent book on longitudinal models by Singer and Willett (2003), and Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2012)’s more recent and extremely comprehensive two volume text. Luke (2004), and Kreft and de Leeuw (1998), offer shorter, less mathematical, but still excellent introductions to the topic of multilevel modeling. Gelman et al. (2007) introduced me to the ideas that in this document I describe as “multilevel structure” using an example with voting patterns.\nMy intent in this document is to offer a kind of accessible tutorial for applied researchers, including especially those who see their research having some advocacy based component. My approach, while offering up some equations, is less mathematical than some of the above mentioned texts, and written with the intent of providing a clear and practically focused guide for the applied researcher who is attempting to carry out better research with diverse populations.\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, Boris Shor, Joseph Bafumi, and David Park. 2007. “Rich State, Poor State, Red State, Blue State: What’s the Matter with Connecticut?” Quarterly Journal of Political Science 2 (November): 345–67. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1010426.\n\n\nKreft, Ita, and Jan de Leeuw. 1998.

    "text": "No good learning happens without community. At least, that has always been true for me. I am grateful for many creative and energizing discussions with the other members of the MICS (UNICEF data) research team: Professor Shawna Lee, Professor Julie Ma, Dr. Kaitlin Ward, and Professor Garrett Pace. I’m thankful for their collegiality, their friendship, and their dedication to good science. I’m also very grateful to one of my mentors, Professor Sandra Danziger, who has taught me so much about the what and the why of mentoring, teaching, and doing research. I’d like to thank Ross Grogan-Kaylor for continued interest in the progress of this document, and probing, thoughtful, and sometimes challenging, questions. Don Deutsch has showed ongoing interest in the development of this document, and has asked some hard questions that have improved its logic. Lastly, and importantly, I’d like to express gratitude to the many students in my class on Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling who over the years have helped me think more deeply about statistical and substantive issues, including Dr. Kaitlin Ward, Professor Garrett Pace, Professor Julie Ma, Professor Berenice Castillo, Professor Maria Galano, Madhur Singh, and Tong Suo. While I’m thankful for the inspiration and colleagueship provided by others, any remaining errors and omissions in this document are of course my responsibility."
