    "text": "1 The Usefulness of Multilevel Modeling and Multilevel Thinking\n\n\n\nFor decades now, multilevel models have been an important quantitative tool for social research. While multilevel models have become ubiquitous in social research, there are aspects of these models that are explored less frequently in published articles. This document arises from my experiences of teaching a course entitled Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling that I have taught for over a decade in the Joint Doctoral Program in Social Work and Social Science at the University of Michigan.\nMy contention is that multilevel modeling offers powerful tools for understanding the multilevel data that social researchers often confront. For example, researchers are often interested in studying outcomes for diverse groups of children in different schools, residents of diverse and different neighborhoods, or individuals or families living in diverse and different countries. Such inherently multilevel data lead to analytic complexities, some of which appear to me to be well understood, while others seem to be much less often appreciated.\nThe point that I wish to make about multilevel data is that when presented with complex multilevel data, failure to use the appropriate multilevel model may lead to conclusions that are demonstrably incorrect. Fortunately, many of these difficulties can be avoided with applications of simple and straightforward multilevel models.\nI first present some initial ideas about multilevel modeling. First, as is relatively commonly understood, multilevel models allow for the correct estimation of p values in the presence of data clustering. Second, as is less commonly appreciated, when data are clustered, multilevel models correctly estimate \\(\\beta\\) regression coefficients and may avoid estimating a regression coefficient that is too large, too small, or even has the wrong sign.\nI go on to explore some more complex ideas about multilevel models that I see less often in the published empirical literature. I focus especially on two ideas: multilevel models as the exploration of variation across countries and cultures; and multilevel models as a foundation for models that let us think more rigorously about causality.\nCertainly, none of the statistical ideas contained in this document are unique to me. There are thorough–and often much more mathematically rigorous–presentations of many of the idea contained in this document in some of the excellent foundational texts on multilevel modeling such as the early book by Raudenbush & Bryk (2002), the excellent book on longitudinal models by Singer & Willett (2003), and Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal (2012)’s more recent and extremely comprehensive two volume text. Luke (2004), and Kreft & de Leeuw (1998), offer shorter, less mathematically rigorous, but still excellent introductions to the topic of multilevel modeling. Gelman et al. (2007) introduced me to the ideas that in this document I describe as “multilevel structure” using an example with voting patterns.\nMy intent in this document is to offer a kind of accessible tutorial for applied researchers, including especially those who see their research having some advocacy based component. My approach, while offering up some equations, is less mathematically rigorous than some of the above mentioned texts, and written with the intent of providing a clear and practically focused guide for the applied researcher who is attempting to carry out better research with diverse populations.\n\n\n\n\nGelman, A., Shor, B., Bafumi, J., & Park, D.

    "section": "2.1 Quantitative Methods and Social Justice",
    "text": "2.1 Quantitative Methods and Social Justice\nThere is clearly need for both qualitative and quantitative methods. Central to the argument of this document is the idea that advanced quantitative methods can be core contributors to the agenda of understanding issues of diversity and social justice more fully and thoroughly (Cokley & Awad, 2013; Grogan-Kaylor et al., 2018). Quantitative methods, particularly in discussions comparing qualitative and quantitative methodologies, are sometimes labelled as inherently positivist methods. My argument regarding this point is twofold. First, there is nothing within the mathematics of quantitative methods that requires a positivist epistemology. Quantitative methodologies could as easily be conducted using a critical epistemology–that is aware of dynamics of power and privilege–as any other methodology (Stage & Wells, 2014). Second, when we have samples of a hundred, several hundred, several thousand, or even hundreds of thousands of study participants, it is difficult to imagine a methodology other than a quantitative methodology that could accomplish the following:\n\nSift through thousands of responses, and determine the overall, or average, pattern of relationships between risk factors, protective factors, and outcomes.\nExplore the variation in these relationships across social contexts.\nDetermine whether there is evidence that the relationships observed within the data are more than statistical noise.\nAdjudicate the complex multivariate relationships of risk factors, protective factors and outcomes.\n\nIn Section 6.2, where I consider the estimation of p values, and Section 6.3, where I consider the signs of regression coefficients, I explore the ways that multilevel data can contribute substantially to the complexity of this enterprise. I thus argue that quantitative methods can play an important role in contributing to liberatory ideas.\nI note that one of the pioneers of liberation psychology, Martin-Baró (Aron & Corne, 1994), used both qualitative and quantitative methods (Martin-Baro, 1994), including in the latter case, relatively sophisticated arguments about patterns of missing data across a survey data set (Aron & Corne, 1994).\nThere is thus an ethical argument that is embedded in this document. Many of us do research with the hope of better understanding the relationship of risk and protective factors with outcomes in diverse, and often disadvantaged or marginalized, populations. Many of us further hope that our work might be part of conversations about appropriate polices, programs, treatments or interventions. Given the frequent vulnerability and marginalization of the people with whom we work, when using quantitative methods, it is incumbent upon us to employ methods that adequately address the complexities of the data, that offer an appreciation of the variability and diversity within the data, that provide the most accurate estimates possible, and that increase the probability of obtaining correct answers to important substantive questions.\n\n“It is hard to imagine that anyone with a humanitarian worldview would argue against the need for a more quantitatively literate citizenry. Informed political decision-making, retirement planning, active parenting, and the vast majority of choices we make in our personal, occupational, and civic lives can be better served by improved quantitative understanding and reasoning, as well as accompanying action-oriented dispositions.” (Wiest et al., 2007)\n\nThe idea of this document is that a deeper study of multilevel modeling can result in an advanced “quantitative literacy” (Wiest et al., 2007), or “principled argument” (Abelson, 1995), that is appropriate for drawing accurate conclusions from multilevel data."

    "section": "2.2 Are Answers from Social Science “Obvious”?",
    "text": "2.2 Are Answers from Social Science “Obvious”?\nClosely related, I think to the the idea that quantitative research can advance issues of social justice, is the question of whether answers from social science are “obvious”. If social science answers are obvious, then social science has limited abilities to make new discoveries, and to build scientific foundations for evidence.\nI have been thinking a lot about the idea that Everything Is Obvious, Once You Know The Answer, as detailed in the book with this title by Duncan Watts (2011).\nThis seems to me especially true in social research. Arguably, some conclusions of social research may indeed be obvious. For example, it may be obvious that Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are associated with long term decreases in mental health. However, even obvious conclusions may need to be quantitatively documented, in order to legitimate programs and interventions, and to secure funding. I also observe that I think that there is often a historical dimension to what is considered “obvious”: conclusions that are at first considered to be unlikely to be true, or even counter-intuitive, require the weight of accumulating evidence over time for these connections to become “obvious”. It is likely that the “obviousness” of the relationship between ACEs and later physical and mental health problems did not become apparent until research began to document these relationships (e.g. Felitti et al. (1998)).\nAs another example, Proctor (2012) documents the way which smoking was first considered to be an unlikely cause of lung cancer; only over the course of several decades of research and discussion to become an obvious cause of lung cancer. A similar historical dynamic seems to be playing out in some research on parenting and child development. Despite decades of evidence indicating that corporal punishment has undesirable conequeqences for children (Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016b), corporal punishment remains a disciplinary strategy endorsed by the majority of the American population (Hines et al., 2022).\nIn contrast sometimes the conclusions of social research may not always be obvious. For example:\n\nThere has been an ongoing debate about whether corporal punishment is more or less harmful when used by parents in social contexts, or communities where it is more common, or normative. Eamon (2001) suggested that “when environmental risk is high, parenting practices that are firmer and higher in control result in lower levels of young adolescent antisocial behavior.” This echoes similar research by (Deater-Deckard et al., 1996) suggesting that physical punishment was harmful for European-American children, but not for African-American children. Later, larger sample research has found that this appears not to be the case: physical punishment is harmful for children in all groups (Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016b, 2016a; Pace et al., 2019).\nUsing MICS Data (UNICEF, 2021), we conducted a study of the link between gender inequality and physical child abuse (Ma et al., 2022). We expected to find that higher levels of gender inequality led to higher levels of physical abuse for female children, but not for male children. Instead, we found that higher levels of gender inequality were associated with higher levels of physical abuse for both male and female children. Additionally, there was some slight evidence that male children were at higher risk of being abused than female children. Equally interesting was that we found that gender inequality was predictive of levels of child abuse, while country level GDP was not.\nIn a study of parenting during Covid-19 (Lee et al., 2022), we expected to find that households with children would experience higher levels of anxiety and depression than households without children. Instead, we found the opposite. Being in a household with children was generally protective against anxiety and depression.\n\nIn Section 2.6, Section 6.2 and Section 6.3, I provide specific examples of how multilevel data provides even more opportunity to present answers that are not obvious."

    "section": "2.3 Presenting Advanced Statistical Ideas",
    "text": "2.3 Presenting Advanced Statistical Ideas\nIn presenting advanced, statistical concepts, one is faced with a quandary. One can present statistical concepts in the most general terms, in terms of x and y. While perhaps the mathematically most general way to present ideas, a highly general (and abstract) presentation risks not being a good way of teaching the ideas, as it is sometimes difficult to apply abstract ideas to one’s own specific area of research.\nAlternatively, one can present statistical ideas in terms of specific substantive concepts. The risk of making use of a specific substantive concept is that while concrete examples are always helpful, it may be difficult for the reader to generalize from a specific example to their own area of research.\nI ground this presentation in research that we have conducted on parenting and child development in international context (Grogan-Kaylor et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2022; Pace et al., 2019; Ward, Grogan-Kaylor, Ma, et al., 2021; Ward, Grogan-Kaylor, Pace, et al., 2021; Ward et al., 2022). For the presentation in this document, I use simulated data on these issues.\nUsing the simulated data, I refer to predictors and outcomes, and explore the ways that the multilevel model can contribute to understanding how relationships between predictors and outcomes might be similar, or might be different, across social contexts. In the examples presented below, I focus on two predictors, parental warmth, and parental use of physical punishment and focus on the outcome of improved mental health. I use the social context of different countries in our example.\nIt is my belief that while I use this specific set of examples, that the idea of studying families in different countries is generalizable enough to a multiplicity of diverse contexts, such that the reader can apply these ideas to their own area of interest, whether that be children in schools; residents in neighborhoods; or people in different countries."

    "text": "2.4 Research on Parenting and Child Development in International Context\nResearch on parenting and child development has identified robust associations between parenting behaviors and child developmental outcomes. Broadly speaking, physical punishment is associated with increases in child aggression, child anxiety and child mental health problems (Gershoff & Grogan-Kaylor, 2016b), while warm and supportive parenting is associated with decreases in these outcomes (Khaleque & Rohner, 2002; Rothenberg et al., 2022). However, much of this research is conducted on North American samples (Draper et al., 2022; Henrich et al., 2010).\nBarth & Olsen (2020) have argued, that children constitute a class of oppressed persons. If children are oppressed, then it is imperative to empirically determine what factors are promotive of children’s well-being, and what factors constitute risk factors that contribute to decreases in children’s well-being. Equally imperative–given the North American focus of so much research on parenting and child development (Draper et al., 2022; Henrich et al., 2010)–would be efforts to extend the study of parenting and child development to a broader, more global context. As part of such a research agenda, it is necessary to have quantitative tools that are able to determine the consistency of relationships in parenting and child development. That is, are the relationships between certain forms of parenting and child developmental outcomes, largely consistent across countries, largely different across countries, or somewhere in between?\nThis document will discuss the ways in which a multilevel statistical perspective not only allows one to appropriately analyze cross cultural or international data, but also the ways in which a multilevel perspective affords the opportunity for more precise quantitative thinking about cross cultural phenomena.\nThis document takes a very pragmatic and very advocacy oriented approach to improving research on families and children, with the aim of improving the well-being of families and children.\n\n“It shouldn’t be theories that define the problems of our situation, but rather the problems that demand, and so to speak, select, their own theorisation.” – Martin-Baro (1998) in Burton & Kagan (2005).\n\nFollowing from this pragmatic and advocacy oriented emphasis, the document is largely oriented to the doing of quantitative social research with multilevel (or multi-country) data, and is therefore mostly statistical in nature.\nThe document moves quickly into detailed statistical arguments. Some of these statistical discussions may seem very technical, or even overly technical. However, an overarching theme of the document is that multilevel data contains hidden complexities. A lack of awareness of the complexities of multilevel data—e.g. complexities of multi-country data—might lead to statistical analyses that point in the wrong direction: yielding false positives; false negatives; or substantively wrong conclusions."

    "section": "2.5 Universalism And Particularity",
    "text": "2.5 Universalism And Particularity\nThe specific domain of cross-cultural research on parenting and child development raises more general questions in cross-cultural research of universalism and particularity. With regard to child development it is universal that all children need some amount of emotional and material care to grow into healthy youth and healthy adults (Kottak, 2021). Further it is broadly understood that children should be protected from violence (UNICEF, 2014). This broad consensus is manifested in such documents as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (United Nations General Assembly, 1989) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2022), representing global efforts to ensure the children are cared for, and are protected against violence.\nAt the same time, broad international efforts to improve children’s well-being must engage with important considerations of cultural uniqueness. Put simply, what is considered to be beneficial for children in one country or culture may not be considered to be beneficial in all countries or cultures. Similarly, what is considered to be detrimental in one country or culture may not equally be considered to be detrimental in all. Within the area of parenting and child development, most of the debate has focused around the question of whether physical punishment is equally detrimental in all settings, particularly whether physical punishment is detrimental in countries where it is especially common, or normative (Gershoff et al., 2010). Much less attention has been focused on the study of positive parenting internationally, and the degree to which the outcomes of positive parenting are consistent across countries remains understudied (Ward, Grogan-Kaylor, Ma, et al., 2021).\nHowever, as global initiatives to improve child well-being and family life move forward, it becomes increasingly important to continue to collect internationally relevant data about parenting and child outcomes. If recommendations are to be made for policies, interventions, or treatments, such recommendations must be based on accurate balancing of that which is universal against that which is unique to particular cultural contexts. Thus it is necessary to employ statistical methods that are able to adequately and accurately analyze data across countries.\nAs I will outline below–and is evident in the literature (Kreft & de Leeuw, 1998; Luke, 2004; Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal, 2012; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Singer & Willett, 2003)–multilevel models are eminently suited for cross-cultural research in that they are not only able to control for the clustering of study participants within countries, but are also able to explore the variation–or consistency–of patterns of family life across countries.\nLong ago, Cesaire, writing about liberatory movements wrote…\n\n“My conception of the universal is that of a universal enriched by all that is particular, a universal enriched by every particular: the deepening and coexistence of all particulars.” (Cesaire, 1956)\n\nIt is this sensibility that I hope to echo in my discussion of the multilevel model below."

    "text": "2.6 Multilevel Models As The Study Of Variation\n\n“Every being cries out silently to be read differently.”\n\n— Simone Weil, Gravity and Grace as reported in Su (2017)\nMultilevel models are sometimes seen as an analytic technique that controls for the clustering or nesting of individuals inside larger social units such as schools, neighborhoods, or countries. I will describe below how this ability to control for clustering is indeed an important and crucial aspect of multilevel models.\nHowever, my argument here is that multilevel models are better seen as a method to explore the variation in inherent within nested or clustered data. Again, while these issues are well understood within the statistical literature (Kreft & de Leeuw, 1998; Luke, 2004; Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal, 2012; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Singer & Willett, 2003), they are less often noted in applied research.\nIn the graph below, imagine that physical punishment, or some other risk factor, is associated with detrimental mental health outcomes. Each country in the data has its own country specific regression line.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Plausible Alternative Patterns of Between Country Variation\n\n\n\n\nIn Panel A, there is some variation in the intercept, which is equivalent to saying that there is some variation in the average level of psychological well-being across countries. When we look at the slope of the country-specific regression lines in Panel A, we notice that there is little variation in these slopes. Put another way, there is a great amount of consistency in the slopes of the country-specific regression lines: parental use of physical punishment is consistently associated with decreases in child psychological wellbeing across countries.\nIn Panel B, the situation is different. There is more variation in the intercept, that is, more variation between countries in the initial or average amount of psychological well-being. There is also more variation in the slopes of the country-specific regression lines. While the average association between physical punishment and psychological well-being is very similar to that in Panel A, there is more variation across countries, in the relationship of physical punishment and child psychological wellbeing, which would likely merit exploration were one considering developing programs, policies or interventions for different countries.\nLastly, the pattern of variation in Panel C is considerably different from either Panel A or Panel B. The average association of physical punishment with psychological well-being in the hypothetical scenario represented by Panel C is approximately 0. There is some variation in the intercepts of the country-specific regression lines. Additionally, there is considerable variation in the slopes of the country-specific regression line, suggesting that the use of physical punishment might be beneficial in some countries, and detrimental in others.\nEmpirically, data generally suggest a scenario somewhere between Panel A and Panel B, but these different hypothetical scenarios afford us the opportunity to think about possible patterns of variation.\nA second pedagogically helpful example might be obtained if we flip the slopes in the diagram, and consider a different set of independent variables, perhaps some kind of treatment or intervention designed to improve psychological well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Considering an Intervention or Treatment Across Countries\n\n\n\n\nWe see a similar pattern as before, but the use of a different substantive example may be illustrative.\nIn Panel A, there is relative consistency in the initial levels of psychological well-being across countries, as well as consistency in the degree to which the intervention is associated with improvements in psychological well-being across countries.\nIn Panel B, we see more variation in both initial levels of psychological well-being, but also more variation in the association of the intervention with improvements in psychological well-being.\nLastly, in Panel C, we note an overall association of the intervention with psychological well-being that is close to zero. However associations vary widely by countries. In some countries there appears to be evidence that the intervention is beneficial, while in other countries there appears to be evidence that the intervention is not beneficial, or even possibly harmful.\nThus, I emphasize an approach to multilevel modeling that sees multilevel modeling as the study of variation, not simply accounting for variation, or controlling for variation.\n\n“…universal theorizing requires adequately sampled (i.e., diverse) data and better appreciation of issues of comparability and the most powerful theories ought to predict and explain variation, not sweep variation under the rug.” (Blasi et al., 2022)\n\nAgain, sophisticated treatments of all of the ideas are available in one form or another across the excellent textbooks on multilevel modeling (Kreft & de Leeuw, 1998; Luke, 2004; Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal, 2012; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Singer & Willett, 2003). However, some of these ideas appear less often in applied research, and my intention here is to make the application of these ideas to applied research more clear.\n\n\n\n\nAbelson, R. P. (1995).

    "section": "6.1 The Equation",
    "text": "6.1 The Equation\nThe equation for the multilevel model can be written in several ways: as multiple levels of equations; or as a single equation. The advantage of having multiple levels of equations is that these multiple equations make clear the multiple levels of the data, and thus conform to an initial understanding of how a multilevel model should be estimated. However, results from multiple levels of equations quickly become difficult to interpret, and thus, I will not spend a great deal of time on discussing empirical results of the two level formulation. Whether multiple levels of equations, or a single equation are employed, the numerical results are the same.\n\n6.1.1 Two Levels of Equations\nI start with two levels of equations: Level 1 at the level of the individual; and Level 2 at the level of the country.\n\n6.1.1.1 Level 1 (Individuals)\n\\[y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j} x_{ij} + \\beta_{2j} z_{ij} + e_{ij} \\tag{6.1}\\]\n\n\n6.1.1.2 Level 2 (Countries)\n\\[\\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} +\\gamma_{01} w_j + u_{0j} \\tag{6.2}\\]\n\\[\\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} + u_{1j}\\]\n\\[\\beta_{2j} = \\gamma_{20}\\]\n\\[\\beta_{3j} = \\gamma_{30}\\]\nHere \\(y_{ij}\\) is the dependent variable, or outcome for the model. We note that the \\(ij\\) subscripts indicate that this is outcome \\(y\\) for individual \\(i\\) in country \\(j\\). Note that the outcome is at Level 1, or the level of individuals. \\(\\beta_{0j}\\) is a regression intercept, and the other \\(\\beta\\)’s1 are regression slope parameters. \\(x_{ij}\\) and \\(z_{ij}\\) are independent variables and \\(t_{ij}\\) is an independent variable indicating the time at which different data points are measured. I note that in this discussion I am not considering a model in which there are repeated observations on the same individuals, although the multilevel model is certainly extensible to such cases. \\(u_{0j}\\) is a random intercept for the \\(\\beta_{0j}\\) term, and \\(u_{1j}\\) is a random slope for the \\(\\beta_{1j}\\) term, indicating that we are modeling cross country variation in these parameters. The other \\(\\beta\\) terms are not modeled as having random country level variation, although this could certainly be a possibility in subsequent models.\nIn this formulation of the multilevel model, each regression parameter \\(\\beta\\) in the level 1 equation is the outcome of an equation at Level 2. The parameters for the Level 2 equations are represented by \\(\\gamma\\)’s. \\(w\\) a Level 2 variable appears in the first Level 2 equation.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 One Level of Equations\nBy simply substituting the values of the Level 2 equations into the Level 1 equations, we obtain:\n\\[y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{ij} + \\beta_2 z_{ij} + \\beta_3 w_{j} + u_{0j} + u_{1j} \\times x + e_{ij} \\tag{6.3}\\]\nHere again \\(y_{ij}\\) is the dependent variable, or outcome for the model. \\(\\beta_0\\) is a regression intercept, and the \\(\\beta\\)’s are regression parameters. \\(x_{ij}\\) and \\(z_{ij}\\) are independent variables and \\(w\\) is a Level 2 variable.\nWhile I purposely strive to keep the discussion of multilevel modeling ideas somewhat general in this document, I generally think of \\(y_{ij}\\) as a desirable or “good” outcome. \\(x\\) is often conceptualized as a protective factor, while \\(z\\) is often conceptualized as a risk factor.\n\nNotice that in this single equation format all variables–no matter their level–appear in the same equation.\n\nIn this formulation of the equation, the nature of the random effects is more clear, and merits discussion. Notice that we have included a random intercept \\(u_{0j}\\) as well as a random slope \\(u_{1j} \\times x\\). The random intercept, \\(u_{0j}\\), indicates that there is variation in the intercept of the country specific regression lines, as is true in Figure 3.2. The random slope term associated with \\(x\\), \\(u_{1j} \\times x\\), indicates that there is also variation in the slope of the regression lines that is associated with \\(x\\), in this case, the slope of parental warmth, as is also demonstrated in Figure 3.2.\nTo make these ideas more concrete, I rewrite this equation in terms of the main substantive ideas of this document:\n\\[\\text{outcome}_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{parental warmth}_{ij} + \\beta_2 \\text{physical punishment}_{ij} + \\beta_3 \\text{group}_{ij} + \\beta_4 \\text{HDI}_{j} \\ +  \\tag{6.4}\\]\n\\[u_{0j} + u_{1j} \\times \\text{parental warmth} + e_{ij}\\]\nDrawing upon ideas from Chapter 4, this single level equation can be easily represented in Stata syntax.\nmixed outcome warmth physical_punishment group HDI || country: warmth"

Bland & Altman (1994) describe a simulation in which grouped data are artificially generated according to the following procedure.\n\n“The data were generated from random numbers, and there is no relation between X and Y at all. Firstly, values of X and Y were generated for each ‘subject,’ then a further random number was added to make the individual observation.” (Bland & Altman, 1994)\n\n\n\n\nThe graph below illustrates the process of simulating the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulated Clustered Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Compare OLS and MLM\nAn analysis that is not aware of the grouped nature of the data will give biased results, will mis-estimate standard errors, and importantly, will often attribute statistical significance to some of the independent variables when this is not appropriate (Bland & Altman, 1994; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).\nIn the example below, we compare a simple ordinary least squares analysis of the data with a multilevel model that accounts for the clustered nature of the data.\nThe Stata syntax that we use for each analysis is:\n\nOLS: regress y x\nMultilevel Model: mixed y x || group:\n\n\n\n\n\nOLS\n\nMLM\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n1.046\n**\n0.039\n\n\n\nIntercept\n4.488\n\n97.005\n**\n\n\nvar(_cons)\n\n\n74.523\n\n\n\nvar(e)\n\n\n0.594\n\n\n\nNumber of observations\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** p<.01, * p<.05\nWe see that in the ordinary least squares analysis, the independent variable is judged to have a statistically significant association with the dependent variable. The more appropriate multilevel model finds that in fact the independent variable \\(x\\) is not associated with \\(y\\). Thus, the multilevel model provides more accurate results than OLS in the presence of clustered data."

In the example presented here, the groups are countries, but could as easily be neighborhoods, communities, or schools.\nFor pedagogical purposes, I use an example with very few clusters, although it would be more appropriate to apply multilevel analysis to an example with many more clusters e.g. (\\(N_\\text{clusters} >= 30\\))\nA model that is “aware” of the clustered nature of the data may provide very different–likely better–substantive conclusions than a model that is not aware of the clustered nature of the data.\n\n6.3.1 Use Some Data Simulated For This Particular Example\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Graphs\n\n6.3.2.1 A “Naive” Graph\nThis “naive” graph is unaware of the grouped nature of the data.

This is surprisingly difficult to think through.\nImagine that x is a protective factor, or an intervention or treatment. Imagine that y is a desirable outcome, like improved mental health or psychological well being.\nNow imagine that residents of countries provide more of the protective factor or more of the intervention in situations where there are lower levels of the desirable outcome. If one thinks about it, this is a very plausible situation.\n\nA naive analysis that was unaware of the grouped nature of the data would therefore misconstrue the results, suggesting that the intervention was harmful, when it was in fact helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Heuristic Example\n\n\n\n\nThese data are constructed to provide this kind of extreme example, but it easy to see how multilevel thinking, and multilevel analysis may provide better answers than one would get if one ignored the grouped nature of the data."

I will again imagine that the desirable outcome is an outcome such as improved psychological wellbeing.\nThe Stata syntax that we use is:\nmixed outcome warmth physical_punishment group HDI || country: warmth\n\n\n\n\ncross_sectional\n\n\n\n\n\nwarmth\n0.983\n**\n\n\nphysical_punishment\n-0.924\n**\n\n\ngroup\n\n\n\n\n2\n0.728\n**\n\n\nHDI\n0.008\n\n\n\nIntercept\n51.500\n**\n\n\nvar(warmth)\n0.000\n\n\n\nvar(_cons)\n3.438\n\n\n\nvar(e)\n34.784\n\n\n\n\n** p<.01, * p<.05\nThe data suggest that parental warmth is positively associated with the desirable outcome, and that this result is statistically significant. Parental use of physical punishment is associated with statistically significant decreases in the desirable outcome. I note that there is some variation in the constant indicating that there is some variation in the initial or average levels of the desirable outcome–again improved psychological well-being–that is attributable to country.\nThere is–in contrast–no discernible variation in the slope associated with parental warmth that is attributable to country. Thus, the relationship of parental warmth with child outcomes does not appear to differ appreciably from country to country.\nHDI, the Human Development Index, our only country level, or Level 2, variable in this model is not associated with the outcome."

    "text": "6.5 Correlation of Random Intercept and Random Slope(s)\nOne could also consider a situation in which a random slope or slopes were correlated with each other, and with the random intercept. In the equation that we are considering, this would entail estimation of whether or not, the random intercept, \\(u_{0j}\\), was correlated with the random slope for warmth, \\(u_{1j}\\).\nSubstantively, this question would be asking whether the association of warmth and the outcome, was correlated with the initial level or average level of the outcome. From Figure 3.2, it appears that there is some slight evidence that the country specific regression slopes are more steep in countries where the initial level of the outcome is higher. However, we may wish to investigate this question more rigorously.\nBy default, Stata estimates models, where the random slope or slopes are uncorrelated with each other, and uncorrelated with the intercept (StataCorp, 2021). We see this in Equation 6.5 below, where the diagonal elements are the variances of each of the random effects, and the off diagonals, which would be the covariances of the random effects are constrained to 0.\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nvar(u_{0j}) & 0 \\\\\n0 & var(u_{1j})\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{6.5}\\]\nWithin Stata, we can ask to allow such a correlation with the cov(uns) option.\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nvar(u_{0j}) & cov(u_{0j}, u_{1j}) \\\\\ncov(u_{0j}, u_{1j}) & var(u_{1j})\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{6.6}\\]\nWe use the following syntax.\nmixed outcome warmth physical_punishment group HDI || country: warmth, cov(uns)\nWhen we estimate such a model, we get the following information.\n\n\n\n\ncross_sectional2\n\n\n\n\n\nwarmth\n0.983\n**\n\n\nphysical_punishment\n-0.926\n**\n\n\ngroup\n\n\n\n\n2\n0.727\n**\n\n\nHDI\n0.007\n\n\n\nIntercept\n51.523\n**\n\n\nvar(warmth)\n0.002\n\n\n\nvar(_cons)\n2.982\n\n\n\ncov(warmth,_cons)\n0.086\n\n\n\nvar(e)\n34.769\n\n\n\n\n** p<.01, * p<.05\nResults are mostly similar to those above. However, here, we are asking additionally for information about the possible correlation of country specific initial levels of the outcome and the slope of the country specific regression line for parental warmth. Results indicate that there is no reason to be believe that these two parameters are correlated. Put more intuitively, it does not appear that parental warmth is any more or less correlated with the outcome in countries where initial levels of the outcome are higher."

    "section": "6.6 Summary of Advantages Of The Multilevel Model",
    "text": "6.6 Summary of Advantages Of The Multilevel Model\nThe discussion so far gives an idea of the advantages of the multilevel model for studying intrinsically multilevel data: children in classrooms or schools; individuals or families in neighborhoods; individuals or families in countries. These advantages can be summarized below:\n\nStandard errors are estimated correctly as is statistical significance. This means that p values are correctly estimated accounting for the clustered or nested nature of the data. More colloquially, this most often means that we do not make the mistake of attributing statistical significance to a given risk or protective factor, when such a statistical significance is not warranted. Put even more straightforwardly correct estimation of standard errors and statistical significance prevents us from seeing results that are simply not present in the data, whether those concern risk factors or protective factors.\nRegression coefficients are estimated correctly accounting for the clustered or nested structure of the data. If one does not account for the clustered or nested structure of the data, regression slopes can be estimated as negative when they are more correctly estimated as positive, or as null, or conversely estimated as positive when there are more correctly seen as negative (or null). Again, to phrase things in a more colloquial fashion, this means that we do not judge something to be a risk factor when it is in fact a protective factor or a null effect; or a protective factor when it is in fact a risk factor, or a null effect.\n\nAn increasing focus of statistical estimation is not to focus on particular regression parameters, but instead to predict outcomes for particular combinations of independent variables. Predictions from a multilevel model could be said to be best predictions in that groups are weighted by their precision, contributing to an estimate which makes better predictions than would a simple average. More colloquially, multilevel models allow us to predict outcomes better and more accurately than would be possible with simple or more naïve models."

    "text": "6.8 Variation\nAbove, in Section 2.6, I have referred to multilevel models as the study of variation. Now that I have provided some discussion of the multilevel model, more statistical “unpacking” of ideas about variation is warranted.\nI provide again, for pedagogical purposes, the example substantive equation that I have been using in this document.\n\\[\\text{outcome}_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{parental warmth}_{ij} + \\beta_2 \\text{physical punishment}_{ij} + \\beta_3 \\text{time}_{ij} \\ +  \\tag{6.7}\\]\n\\[u_{0j} + u_{1j} \\times \\text{parental warmth} + e_{ij}\\]\n\n6.8.1 Measured and Unmeasured Variation\nThe first thing to note about the equation is that it can be divided into measured and unmeasured variation.\nThis is most easily seen if we introduce the idea of an unconditional model.\n\n\n6.8.2 Unconditional Model\nThe unconditional model is a model with no \\(x\\)’s or covariates (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).\n\\[\\text{outcome}_{ij} = \\beta_0 + u_{0j} + e_{ij} \\tag{6.8}\\]\nHere, \\(\\text{outcome}_{ij}\\) is a function of an intercept \\(\\beta_0\\), a country specific error term, \\(u_{0j}\\), and an individual level error term \\(e_{ij}\\).\nThus, all of the variation in \\(\\text{outcome}_{ij}\\) is–given the unconditional nature of our model–due to unmeasured variation at the country and individual level.\n\n\n6.8.3 Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient\nI now introduce a measure known as the Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient, (ICC) that can be computed from this unconditional model (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).\n\\[\\text{ICC} = \\frac{var(u_{0j})}{var(u_{0j}) + var(e_{ij})} \\tag{6.9}\\]\nHeuristically:\n\\[\\text{ICC} = \\frac{\\text{group level variation}}{\\text{group level variation} + \\text{individual level variation}} \\tag{6.10}\\]\nThe ICC from the unconditional model (Equation 6.8) is the most informative ICC as it represents the amount of variation in the dependent variable that could potentially be explained by the grouping variable.\nAs we add covariates, \\(x\\)’s, to the model the ICC will most often decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Sources of Variation in a Multilevel Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.4 Variation In Intercepts or Outcomes\nIn Equation 6.7, \\(var(u_{0j})\\) is the model estimated amount of variation in the outcome, \\(y_{ij}\\).\nIn the regression in Section 6.4, there is discernible between country variation, but more of the variation is between individuals within the same country. Put another way, there is a moderate tendency for children in families in the same country to have similar outcomes, but two children in families in the same country may also have very different outcomes. Children from families in different countries may be as similar as children from families in the same country.\n\n\n6.8.5 Variation In Predictors\nEqually important, I think, but much less frequently explored than variation in outcomes, is the possibility of variation in predictors. In the substantive example that we have employed so far, the predictors are different parenting behaviors, so considering variation in predictors allows us to consider variation in parenting behaviors, as well as variation in the outcomes of those behaviors.\nWe would estimate variation in behaviors in much the same way that we would estimate variation in outcomes, estimating an unconditional model, but substituting \\(x\\) for \\(y\\).\n\\[x_{ij} = \\beta_0 + u_{0j} + e_{ij} \\tag{6.11}\\]\nThen, similarly, the variation in a predictor attributable to the clustered nature of the data–in this case the clustering of individuals in countries–is given by:\n\\[\\text{ICC}_x = \\frac{var(u_{0j})}{var(u_{0j}) + var(e_{ij})} \\tag{6.12}\\]\n\n\n6.8.6 Variation in Slopes\nAnother possible type of variation to investigate is variation in the relationship of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), which is represented in the multilevel model by examining variation in the \\(\\beta\\)’s.\n\n\n6.8.7 Variation As An Outcome\nEven less common is to examine variation itself as an outcome (Burkner, 2018).\n\\[\\sigma_{yij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + u_{0j} + e_{ij} \\tag{6.13}\\]\nHere, the variation in the outcome, \\(\\sigma_{yij}\\), rather than the mean level of the outcome, \\(y_{ij}\\), is the focus of interest. My notation for Equation 6.13 draws upon Burkner (2018)’s notation, but is modified in order to be consistent with the rest of this document.\nWhy might such models be of conceptual interest? Imagine for example, that the variation in psychological well-being is higher in countries with higher levels of poverty, or higher levels of income inequality. The use of such models as this, discussed in more detail by Burkner (2018), would allow us to explore such a question.\nOf note, while I do not explore in detail differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches to multilevel modeling in this document, these models are likely to be only estimable with Bayesian software rather than with frequentist software (Burkner, 2018).\n\n\n6.8.8 Maximal Models\nHypothetically, one might imagine that there could be group level unobserved factors which affect regression slopes—i.e. the relationship between a predictor x and outcome variable y—arguably, were one to ignore these unobserved factors in statistical estimation, they would show up either in an error term, or in the regression coefficients themselves. Were they to show up in the regression coefficients this would represent statistical bias and a substantive mis-estimation of important effects. thus, there is a conceptual argument for including as many random effects—i.e. random slopes—in a statistical model as possible.\nModels with all possible random effects are termed maximal models (Barr et al., 2013; Frank, 2018). Such models include a large number of random slopes, e.g. \\(u_1 \\times x_1, u_2 \\times x_2, u_3 \\times x_3, ..., \\text{etc.}\\) even when some of those estimated slopes are close to 0. Such models may be more easily estimable when using Bayesian estimation (Frank, 2018), a topic which I do not cover in detail in this document.\nIt should be noted that Matuschek et al. (2017) argue that such a maximal approach may lead to a loss of statistical power and further argue that one should adhere to “a random effect structure that is supported by the data.” In contrast, Nalborczyk et al. (2019) argue that maximal models are supported under the Bayesian approach. Oberauer (2022) also argues for including multiple random slopes. Schielzeth & Forstmeier (2009) make a similar argument from a frequentist perspective."

    "text": "6.9 Some Wrong (or Partially Wrong) Approaches\nWhen data are clustered–e.g. residents in neighborhoods, children in schools, families in countries–it is worth discussing the fact that we have several choices statistically as how to proceed, other than using a multilevel model. Given the discussion so far, we can see the advantages of a multilevel model over these other approaches:\n\nFirst, we could simply ignore the clustering, and treat the data as though it were composed of statistically independent individuals, i.e. statistically independent \\(e_i\\). As we have discussed above, however, this approach has at least two disadvantages. First, as discussed in Section 6.2, this approach will mis-estimate standard errors, most often underestimating them, resulting in underestimated p values and false positives. Second, as discussed in Section 6.3 ignoring clustering runs the risk of estimating regression \\(\\beta\\)’s that are not estimated with information about the multilevel structure of the data, with the possibility that \\(\\beta\\) coefficients may not only have incorrect statistical significance, but also incorrect magnitude, and even incorrect sign.\nA second approach would be to aggregate the data to the level of the higher social unit, e.g. aggregating the data at the level of the neighborhood. Here we run into an idea similar to that discussed in Section 6.3, the “ecological fallacy”: the idea that group level and individual level relationships are necessarily the same (Firebaugh, 2001).\nLastly, we could adopt a statistical strategy of clustering the standard errors. Clustering the standard errors means that standard errors are corrected for the non-independence of the \\(e_i\\) within clusters. Thus, p values are estimated correctly. However, clustering still does not account for the multilevel structure of the data (Section 6.3), and thus when relationships between x’s and y at different levels of the data are very different, simply clustering the standard errors may not give correct estimates of the \\(\\beta\\)’s.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarr, D.

    "text": "7.6 Causality\n\n7.6.1 The Importance of Causal Reasoning\nCausal reasoning is sometimes considered to be a statistical–or even overly technical–concern. Arguably, however, whenever one is using research to make recommendations about interventions, or treatments, or policies, one is engaging in some form of causal reasoning (Duncan & Gibson-Davis, 2006).\n\nIf one is saying that implementing x would result in beneficial changes in y, one is arguing–at least implicitly–that x is one of the causes of y.\n\nIt then behooves one to be explicit about this chain of causal reasoning. For example, to continue one of the substantive examples of this document, if one is going to argue for programs, interventions, or treatments that promote parental warmth, or that discourage parental use of physical punishment with the aim of improving children’s mental health, one must be at least reasonably sure that parental warmth and physical punishment are causes of children’s mental health.\nRandomized studies provide the best evidence about the internal validity of causal relationships. However, randomized studies have certain limitations (Diener et al., 2022). First of all–especially in a study with a smaller sample–randomization may not always be perfect, and the control and treatment groups may not be statistically equivalent. Secondly, because of ethical concerns some studies can not be conducted with randomization (Diener et al., 2022). For example, in the study of parenting and child development, children cannot ethically be assigned to parents with different styles of parenting and followed over the long term. Thus, methods that provide rigorous causal estimation with observational methods are necessary (Diener et al., 2022).\nBecause of the assumed superiority of studies that employ randomization, it is sometimes maintained that correlation is not causation and that studies that do not make use of randomization are only observational and correlational, and that results from observational studies cannot be used to support causal conclusions. However, in an important review (Waddington et al., 2022) suggested that studies using appropriately quantitative methods can provide causally robust conclusions.\nIn a statement salient for social research, Duncan & Gibson-Davis (2006) point out the logical inconsistency of writing that does not rigorously address causal processes, but then goes on to suggest interventions or treatment or policies:\n\n“Developmental studies are usually careful to point out when their data do not come from a randomized experiment. As with much of the nonexperimental literature in developmental psychology, most of the articles then go on to assert that, as a consequence, it is impossible to draw causal inferences from the analysis. Indeed, much of their language describing results is couched in terms of ‘associations’ between child care quality and child outcomes. It is not uncommon, however, to see these papers make explicit statements about effects, and others draw explicit policy conclusions. For instance, NICHD (1997, 876) stated, ‘The interaction analyses provided evidence that high-quality child care served a compensatory function for children whose maternal care was lacking.’ On the policy side, NICHD (2002c, 199) asserted, ‘These findings provide empirical support for policies that improve state regulations for caregiver training and child-staff ratios.’”\n\n\n“One cannot have it both ways. Studies that do not aspire to causal analysis should make no claim whatsoever about effects and draw no policy conclusions. At the same time, it would be a terrible waste of resources to conduct expensive longitudinal studies without attempting to use them for causal modeling.”\n\nLastly, because of their often small samples, randomized studies may have high internal validity, but much lower external validity, or generalization to larger populations (Diener et al., 2022). This issue of generalizability becomes increasingly salient, when we are reminded of the fact that so little social and psychological research has been conducted outside of North American contexts (Draper et al., 2022; Henrich et al., 2010). It is necessary to make use of broadly representative observational data sets, and appropriately sophisticiated quantitative methods to make causally robust conclusions from observational data.\n\n\n7.6.2 Formal Criteria of Causality\nFor x to be a cause of y, one needs the following 3 things to be true (Holland, 1986).\n\nx is (are) associated with (correlated with) y.\nx come(s) before y in time.\nz–or other factors–cannot explain the association of (correlation of) x and y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Formal Criteria of Causality\n\n\n\n\n\nIf z is omitted from the regression model, then the estimates for \\(x \\rightarrow y\\) (i.e. \\(\\beta_{x \\rightarrow y}\\)) will be biased. In the most common scenario \\(\\beta_{x \\rightarrow y}\\) will likely be an over-estimate of the effect, and statistical significance of \\(\\beta_{x \\rightarrow y}\\) may represent a false positive.\n\nIt is likely useful to restate the above abstract statements in terms of the substantive issues that I have been considering so far in this document.\nFor parenting to be a cause of child outcomes, one needs the following 3 things to be true (Holland, 1986).\n\nparenting is (are) associated with (correlated with) child outcomes.\nparenting come(s) before child outcomes in time.\nSES, community characteristics–or other factors–cannot explain the association of (correlation of) parenting and child outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Formal Criteria of Causality\n\n\n\n\nIf other factors are omitted from the regression model, then the estimates for \\(\\text{parenting} \\rightarrow \\text{child outcome}\\) (i.e. \\(\\beta_{\\text{parenting} \\rightarrow \\text{child outcome}}\\)) will be biased. In the most common scenario \\(\\beta_{\\text{parenting} \\rightarrow \\text{child outcome}}\\) will likely be an over-estimate of the effect, and statistical significance of \\(\\beta_{\\text{parenting} \\rightarrow \\text{child outcome}}\\) may represent a false positive.\n\n\n7.6.3 Simpson’s Paradox\nEarlier, in Section 6.3, I referred to the idea of multilevel structure wherein failure to account for the clustering of data–omission of \\(u_0\\) from the equation being estimated–may lead to incorrect conclusions. A closely related phenomenon is that of Simpson’s Paradox (Simpson, 1951) wherein omission of a relevant covariate (e.g. SES, community characteristics, country level characteristics) may also lead to dramatically incorrect results.\nStatistically, we imagine a situation where the true model is:\n\\[\\text{child outcome}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{parenting}_{it} + \\beta_2 \\text{community or country characteristic}_{it} + e_{it}\\] If community or country characteristics in fact influence outcome, but are not included in the statistical model, perhaps because they are not measured in the data, then the estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\) for parenting will be biased. See Figure 7.5 for an illustration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: An Illustration of Simpson’s Paradox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.4 A Simpler Multilevel Model To Explore Causality\nFor purposes of explication of ideas about causal estimation, in this section, I imagine a simpler equation where I am only considering the clustering of person timepoints within individual people, and ignoring for the moment–again for the sake of exposition–the clustering of individuals within countries.\nAfter explication and comprehension of this model, however, it is a simple matter to add back in the random effects for country level clustering.\nThe appropriate multilevel model is below.\n\\[\\text{outcome}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{parental warmth}_{it} + \\beta_2 \\text{physical punishment}_{it} + \\beta_3 \\text{time}_{it} \\ +  \\tag{7.2}\\]\n\\[\\beta_4 \\text{group}_{it} + \\beta_5 \\text{HDI}_{it} \\ +\\]\n\\[v_{0i} + e_{it}\\]\nNote that in Equation 7.2, if one were estimating a multilevel model, one would consider the \\(v_{0i}\\) to be a randomly varying parameter with a mean of 0, and a variance of \\(\\sigma^2(v_{0i})\\).\n\n\n7.6.5 Fixed Effects Regression\nI can use the same equation:\n\\[\\text{outcome}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{parental warmth}_{it} + \\beta_2 \\text{physical punishment}_{it} + \\beta_3 \\text{time}_{it} \\ +  \\tag{7.3}\\]\n\\[\\beta_4 \\text{group}_{it} + \\beta_5 \\text{HDI}_{it} \\ +\\]\n\\[v_{0i} + e_{it}\\]\nHowever, in Equation 7.3, I now consider the \\(v_{0i}\\) to be estimable for each individual \\(i\\) in the data. In effect, the \\(v_{0i}\\) become a unique indicator variable for each individual in the data set. This is known as a fixed effects regression model.\nDetails are provided in Allison (2009) and Wooldridge (2010). StataCorp (2021b) provides an exceptionally clear explication of the core idea of fixed effects regression. The essential idea is that the fixed effects model provides statistical control for all time invariant characteristics of study participants, such as–as is often the case in many data sets–their racial or ethnic identity, or neighborhood of residence, or other characteristics which by definition are time invariant, such as the region of the country or city in which a respondent was born.\nThus, by ruling out many potential confounds, fixed effects regression methods provide much more causally robust analyses, specifically because they control for many more possible confounding variables than do standard regression methods, including multilevel models, which are only able to control for the variables that are measured in the study and that are included within the regression model.\nHowever, a disadvantage of the fixed effects approach is that this approach can not provide estimates for any time invariant characteristic of study participants. Indeed, if one includes time invariant variables into a fixed effects regression, they are automatically dropped from the regression results as can be seen in the regression table below.\nThe relevant Stata commands are:\n\nMultilevel Model: mixed outcome t warmth physical_punishment group HDI || id:\nFixed Effects Model: xtreg outcome t warmth physical_punishment group HDI, i(id) fe\n\n\n\n\n\nMLM\n\nFE\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n0.993\n**\n0.993\n**\n\n\nwarmth\n1.070\n**\n1.035\n**\n\n\nphysical_punishment\n-0.940\n**\n-0.955\n**\n\n\ngroup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n0.784\n**\n\n\n\n\nHDI\n0.004\n\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n50.536\n**\n51.279\n**\n\n\nvar(_cons)\n12.436\n\n\n\n\n\nvar(e)\n25.997\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of observations\n\n\n9000\n\n\n\n\n** p<.01, * p<.05\nIn comparing the multilevel model and the fixed effects regression, we note a few salient difference. First, the fixed effects are similar to the multilevel model coefficients. (Most often, the fixed effect regression coefficients are attenuated versions of the multilevel model coefficients, but not always.) The fixed effects regression coefficients for variables that have some variation over time, provide estimates that control for all time invariant variables in the model.\nSecond, estimates for any quantities that do not vary over time, in this case, group membership, and HDI, are not available from the fixed effects regression.\n\n\n7.6.6 The Correlated Random Effects Model\nThe correlated random effects model is based upon ideas first developed by Mundlak (1978) and later explicated in Wooldridge (2010). Antonakis et al. (2021) and Schunck (2013) provide very intuitive explanations of this model.\nThe central idea is that one can obtain estimates of both the time invariant variables, and estimates for time varying variables. The key idea is that for time varying variables, I include the individual level mean for that variable in the model. Thus, in the example below, I include \\(\\beta_{1a}\\overline{\\text{parental warmth}}_{i}\\).\n\\[\\text{outcome}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{parental warmth}_{it} + \\beta_{1a}\\overline{\\text{parental warmth}}_{i} \\ +  \\tag{7.4}\\]\n\\[\\beta_2 \\text{physical punishment}_{it} + \\beta_3 \\text{time}_{it} \\ + \\]\n\\[\\beta_4 \\text{group}_{it} + \\beta_5 \\text{HDI}_{it} \\ +\\]\n\\[v_{0i} + e_{ij}\\]\nBy including this parameter, I obtain estimates for the time varying variables that are equivalent to what I would obtain from a fixed effects regression (Schunck, 2013).\nThe Stata command for the correlated random effects model is:\nmixed outcome t warmth mean_warmth physical_punishment group HDI || id:\n\n\n\n\nMLM\n\nFE\n\nCRE\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n0.993\n**\n0.993\n**\n0.993\n**\n\n\nwarmth\n1.070\n**\n1.035\n**\n1.035\n**\n\n\nphysical_punishment\n-0.940\n**\n-0.955\n**\n-0.955\n**\n\n\ngroup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n0.784\n**\n\n\n0.784\n**\n\n\nHDI\n0.004\n\n\n\n0.004\n\n\n\nmean_warmth\n\n\n\n\n0.042\n\n\n\nmean_physicalpunishment\n\n\n\n\n0.020\n\n\n\nIntercept\n50.536\n**\n51.279\n**\n50.510\n**\n\n\nvar(_cons)\n12.436\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvar(e)\n25.997\n\n\n\n25.996\n\n\n\nvar(_cons)\n\n\n\n\n12.436\n\n\n\nNumber of observations\n\n\n9000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** p<.01, * p<.05\nNote a couple of things from this table. First, results from the correlated random effects model, and the fixed effects regression model are exactly the same for time varying variables, t, warmth, and physical_punishment. Again, these coefficients for time varying variables are estimated with statistical control for all time invariant characteristics of study subjects, whether those characteristics are observed, or unobserved. Secondly, unlike the fixed effects regression, coefficients for time invariant variables, e.g. group, HDI, mean levels of warmth, and mean levels of physical_punishment are provided, just as they would be in the multilevel model.\n\n\n\n\nAllison, P.

    "text": "Many data sets relevant to the study of important social issues, or social problems, are inherently multilevel. For example, data on diverse children in schools, diverse individuals in neighborhoods, and individuals or families in diverse and different countries all have multilevel structures in which individuals are clustered in higher level social structures. Data with repeated measures, sometimes termed panel data, can also be thought of as multilevel data sets, wherein individual timepoints are nested inside individuals, who may in turn be nested or clustered in larger social units such as countries.\nFailure to use appropriate basic multilevel models with such multilevel data can lead to answers that are either biased, or demonstrably wrong. Simple multilevel models allow the researcher to correctly estimate statistical significance, and to correctly estimate regression coefficients while accounting for multilevel structure. More advanced applications of multilevel models allow the researcher to explore the variation in both predictors and outcomes–and the relationship of predictors to outcomes–and to characterize the extent of this variation. Lastly, multilevel models provide a foundation for thinking about closely related models–fixed effects regression, and correlated random effects models–that provide methods for estimation that afford stronger causal conclusions.\nThus, for applied researchers, interested in addressing a variety of social problems and social issues with diverse samples of individuals, multilevel models present a method to think clearly about variation, to explore that variation, and to extend that thinking about variation to estimate more causally robust models within the context of diversity and variation."

    "text": "I am a Professor at the University of Michigan School of Social Work.\nMy interests are in developing more knowledge to reduce violence against children and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), with the aim of improving child and family well-being. It is my hope that a better understanding of how to reduce violence against children, and how to reduce ACEs, will contribute to a better understanding of how to improve mental health and well-being across the lifespan. In this research I try to understand the family and community origins of aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety and depression. My current research focuses on parenting and child development in international context. I try to understand these issues within the context of current conversations about children’s rights.\nA particular focus of my work has been to examine the outcomes of physical punishment. Working closely with many colleagues, we have shown that physical punishment is associated with a wide variety of negative outcomes, even when used minimally, or when used in ostensibly “normative” ways.\nI teach courses mostly in the area of statistics, quantitative methods and data visualization."
