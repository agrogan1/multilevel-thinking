I use simulated data in this example. Data come from 30 hypothetical countries. Data contain measures of a few key aspects of parenting[^parenting] or caregiving that have proven salient in the empirical literature on parenting to date: parental `warmth`, and `physical punishment`. Both parenting measures are normally distributed variables, and are considered to be *Level 1*, or *individual level* variables. `group` is a hypothetical--and somewhat arbitrary--group designation that could hypothetically refer to something like different economic groups, or groups from different parts of the country. `group` is also a *Level 1* variable.

[^parenting]: I use the term parenting throughout this book, but am aware that such parenting may come from biological parents, or from other caregivers.

`HDI` is a measure of the *Human Development Index* [@UNDPHDI], and is measured at the *country level*, or *Level 2*. (I discuss more in depth thinking about levels of the data in @sec-conceptualframework.)

Our `outcome` is conceptualized as a positive mental health outcome or behavioral outcome, and higher levels of `outcome` are considered to be better. Statistically, the data are clustered within countries.

In this simulation, I construct the data so that `warmth` is positively related to the `outcome`, while `physical punishment` is negatively related to the `outcome`.

```{r}

simulated_multilevel_data <-
  read_dta("./simulate-and-analyze-multilevel-data/simulated_multilevel_data.dta")

simulated_multilevel_data <- simulated_multilevel_data %>% 
  select(id, country,
         warmth,
         physical_punishment,
         group,
         HDI,
         outcome)

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-simulateddata
#| tbl-cap: "Simulated Multilevel Data"

pander::pander(head(simulated_multilevel_data))

```


```{r}
#| label: fig-data
#| fig-cap: "Graph of Simulated Data"
#| fig-height: 6

ggplot(simulated_multilevel_data,
       aes(x = warmth,
           y = outcome,
           color = factor(country))) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = "country") +
  labs(title = "Desirable Mental Health Outcome by Parental Warmth",
       subtitle = "By Country",
       caption = "Simulated Data",
       x = "parental warmth",
       y = "desirable mental health outcome") +
  theme_minimal()
