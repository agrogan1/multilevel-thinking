I use simulated data in this example. Data come from 30 hypothetical countries. `country` is a numeric variable ranging from 1 to 30.[^country] Data contain measures of a few key aspects of parenting[^parenting] or caregiving that have proven salient in the empirical literature on parenting to date: parental `warmth`, and `physical punishment`. Both parenting measures are normally distributed variables, and are considered to be *Level 1*, or *individual level* variables. 

[^country]: The `country` variable demonstrates an important point. Data for a grouping, nesting, or clustering variable does *not* need to identify the actual groups by name, but only needs to distinguish the groups from one another. Put another way, the data for the grouping variable can be anonymous about the actual identities of the grouping variable.

`identity` is a hypothetical designation of an identity, such as a race, ethnicity, or gender identity. In this simulated data, identity has two categories--for ease of presentation--but could easily be a more than two category variable. `identity` is also a *Level 1* variable.

Many readers will be interested in using multilevel models to evaluate interventions. The variable `intervention` represents a program, treatment or intervention to which study participants have been assigned. `intervention` is a *Level 1* variable. Assignment to interventions may or may not be random, a topic which is considered in more detail in @sec-causality.

[^parenting]: I use the term parenting throughout this book, but am aware that such parenting may come from biological parents, or from other caregivers.

`HDI` is a measure of the *Human Development Index* [@UNDPHDI], and is measured at the *country level*, or *Level 2*. (I discuss more in depth thinking about levels of the data in @sec-conceptualframework.)

Our `outcome` is conceptualized as a positive mental health outcome or behavioral outcome, and higher levels of `outcome` are considered to be better. Statistically, the data are clustered within countries.

## Download The Data 

Data are presented in Stata format. The Appendix considers the analysis of multilevel models using multiple software packages: Stata, R & Julia, but Stata format is used to store the data as it can be read by each of these software packages.

* [Longitudinal Data](https://github.com/agrogan1/multilevel-thinking/raw/main/simulate-and-analyze-multilevel-data/simulated_multilevel_longitudinal_data.dta)
:::

In this simulation, I construct the data so that `warmth` is positively related to the `outcome`, while `physical punishment` is negatively related to the `outcome`.

```{r}

simulated_multilevel_data <-
  read_dta("./simulate-and-analyze-multilevel-data/simulated_multilevel_data.dta")

simulated_multilevel_data <- simulated_multilevel_data %>% 
  select(id, 
         country,
         warmth,
         physical_punishment,
         identity,
         intervention,
         HDI,
         outcome)

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-simulateddata
#| tbl-cap: "Simulated Multilevel Data"

pander::pander(head(simulated_multilevel_data))

```


```{r}
#| label: fig-data
#| fig-cap: "Graph of Simulated Data"
#| fig-height: 6

ggplot(simulated_multilevel_data,
       aes(x = warmth,
           y = outcome,
           color = factor(country))) +
  # geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = "country") +
  labs(title = "Desirable Mental Health Outcome by Parental Warmth",
       subtitle = "By Country",
       caption = "Simulated Data",
       x = "parental warmth",
       y = "desirable mental health outcome") +
  theme_minimal()
