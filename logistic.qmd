Logistic Regression

New forms of the multi-level model are required when we have outcomes that are not continuous. let us imagine, for example, that we have a situation in which our continuous outcome is now categorized into two groups. for example, we might imagine that there is some sort of diagnostic cut off. scores greater than this cutoff or assigned to one group, well scores lower than the cutoff are assigned to another group. no doubt the scenario is more likely when we consider an undesirable outcome like depression or anxiety. higher levels of depression or anxiety might be greater than some diagnostic cutoff, meriting a score of one - meets criteria for a diagnosis, while scores lower than that diagnostic cut off might receive a score of zero - does not meet diagnostic criteria. however, in keeping with our characterization of the outcome as desirable or beneficial we may also Imagine a situation in which one is assigned to sufficiently high levels of some desirable or beneficial outcome that exceed some threshold value, what scores below that value are assigned to be zero.

Pedagogically, this news categorical outcome satisfies our need to have a dichotomous outcome to explain a new group of models - - logistic regression models and dash that are suitable for such outcomes. statistically it is sometimes considered to be a statistical rule of thumb that we should never dichotomize a continuous outcome. certainly, it is true that when we dichotomize an outcome we lose a certain amount of information in the data about the variation in the outcome. such a loss of information May reduce our ability to obtain statistically significant results. at the same time, certain numerical cutoffs may have important substantive meanings, clinical meetings, or policy meanings. for example has already considered higher levels of anxiety or depression May exceed clinically important cutoffs in playing a diagnosis one versus zero of depression or anxiety. levels of income below a certain threshold and dash whether a country specific threshold or some globally relevant threshold and dash are considered to be in poverty, while individuals above that income threshold considered to be not in poverty one versus zero. in the example considered in detail in this chapter, families with a child having a beneficial outcome of a certain level might be considered to satisfy a certain minimal level of psychological well-being. some outcomes are naturally dichotomous: born versus not born married or partner versus single, alive versus dead; entered a program; exited program; conflict or protest occurred versus down not occur. 

I now consider two possible strategies from modeling a psychotomous outcomes: the linear multi-level model that we have been considering so far in this book; and a quote logistic regression quote model design specifically for dichotomous outcomes. the easiest way to consider and compare these models is through presentation.

In each model, the birth death meets diagnostic Criterion equivalent pattern of dots represents some dichotomous outcome that becomes more likely as some independent variable increases in value. at higher levels of the independent variable, the outcome is almost exclusively one. at lower levels of the independent variable Valcom is almost exclusively zero. one could try to estimate this dichotomous outcome with a straight line, or linear model, is depicted in the left hand panel of figure xxx. this might be roughly plausible, and this procedure is termed a linear probability model which I will not discuss in more detail here. so if I said to say that several problems emerge for Millennial probability model: the model predicts values of the outcome greater than one and less than 0; standard errors of the model are clearly not homoscedastic but change in value SX changes heteroscedasticity and lastly a linear model estimates a constant association between changes in X when this is not appropriate.
