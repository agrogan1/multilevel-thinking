A short book, or long paper, on multilevel thinking.

## To-Do's

* better initial justification / need for MLM
* better explanation of random slopes
* simulated data needs an L2 variable
* within and between
* correlation of random intercept and random slope
* should I include multiple software? e.g. Stata, R, Julia? Possibly brms/STAN, although this would involve discussion of Bayesian estimation?
