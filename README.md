## To-Do's

* better initial justification / need for MLM
* better explanation of random slopes
* simulated data needs an L2 variable
* within and between
* correlation of random intercept and random slope
* include concise summary tables, from maize and blue handout on cross-sectional MLM, and green handout on longitudinal MLM as tables in document.
* include concise summary section, from class discussion, on advantages of MLM for longitudinal data
* should I include multiple software? e.g. Stata, R, Julia? Possibly brms/STAN, although this would involve discussion of Bayesian estimation?
