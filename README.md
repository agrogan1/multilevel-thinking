# multilevel-thinking

A short book, or long paper, on multilevel thinking.

## To-Do's

* Is the title too long? Alternative title suggestion: *Multilevel Thinking: Using Multilevel Models to Engage With Diversity in Cross Cultural Research*
* better explanation of random slopes
* within and between
* should I include multiple software? e.g. Stata, R, Julia? SAS? Possibly brms/STAN, although this would involve discussion of Bayesian estimation?
* Read Stein’s Paradox article
* include concise summary tables, from <span style="background-color:#FFCB05;color:black">maize</span> and <span style="background-color:#00274C;color:white">blue</span> handout on cross-sectional MLM, and <span style="background-color:#A5A508;color:black">green</span> handout on longitudinal MLM as tables in document.
* include concise summary section, from notes for class, on advantages of MLM for longitudinal data
* ✓ (for cross-sectional model; need to clarify this for longitudinal model) correlation of random intercept and random slope
* ✓ updated simulated data set per Stata blog
* ✓ better initial justification / need for MLM
* ✓ simulated data needs an L2 variable
* ✓ `DiagrammeR` doesn't seem to work with Quarto book PDF's so I am exporting to PNG and using those. Can this be fixed?
