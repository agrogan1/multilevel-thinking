## To-Do's

* better initial justification / need for MLM
* better explanation of random slopes
* simulated data needs an L2 variable
* within and between
* correlation of random intercept and random slope
* include concise summary tables, from <span style="background-color:#FFCB05;color:black">maize</span> and <span style="background-color:#00274C;color:white">blue</span> handout on cross-sectional MLM, and <span style="background-color:#A5A508;color:black">green</span> handout on longitudinal MLM as tables in document.
* include concise summary section, from notes for class, on advantages of MLM for longitudinal data
* should I include multiple software? e.g. Stata, R, Julia? Possibly brms/STAN, although this would involve discussion of Bayesian estimation?
* Read Steinâ€™s Paradox article
* `DiagrammeR` doesn't seem to work with Quarto book PDF's so I am exporting to PNG and using those. Can this be fixed?
