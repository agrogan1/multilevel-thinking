A book draft of an introduction to multilevel thinking.

## To-Do's

* New title: 
    + *Multilevel Thinking: Using Multilevel Models to Engage With Diversity in Cross Cultural Research*
    + ~*Multilevel Thinking: Discovering Universals and Particulars in Cross-Cultural Research*~
* Should I include multiple software? e.g. Stata, R, Julia? SAS? Possibly brms/STAN--probably not--because this would involve discussion of Bayesian estimation? Probably only Stata, R and Julia.
* may need to move section on ICC and unconditional models
* read Stein’s Paradox article
* ✓ better explanation of random slopes
* ✓ within and between
* include concise summary tables
    + ✓ from maize and blue handout on cross-sectional MLM
    + from green handout on longitudinal MLM as tables in document.
* include concise summary section, from notes for class, on advantages of MLM for longitudinal data
* ✓ (for cross-sectional model; **need to clarify this for longitudinal model**) correlation of random intercept and random slope
* ✓ add selection on philosophy of science
* ✓ updated simulated data set per Stata blog
* ✓ better initial justification / need for MLM
* ✓ simulated data needs an L2 variable
* ✓ `DiagrammeR` doesn't seem to work with Quarto book PDF's so I am exporting to PNG and using those. Can this be fixed?
